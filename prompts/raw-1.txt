Now lets create a plan to integrate auth (firebase+custom jwt) and the endpoints from our backend service. We have all static ui elements already in the frontend project.

Here is summary

1. Firebase auth is there to authenticate the user from frontend. Once logged in/ signed up, we will send the firebase token to our backend and get back a custom jwt token that will be used to call all the endpoints from our backend service. 
2. This app is mainly to manage cv. 
3. First once the user is logged in, we will check if he already have any cv in our database. If not, we will take him to the create or import cv page. 
4. They can start creating it manually or upload an existing cv. We have an endpoint to upload cv from frontend.
